# 🧠 Yocto Kata Overview

Welcome to the Yocto Kata series — a step-by-step learning path to master building custom embedded Linux systems with the Yocto Project.

Each part builds on the previous one, gradually introducing more powerful and maintainable workflows.

## 📚 Kata Parts

### 🔹 [Part 1: Project Aim, Yocto Background & Host Setup](kata_part_1.md)
Learn what the Yocto Project is, how it works, and why we’re using it. Then prepare your host system with all required tools to begin.

### 🔹 [Part 2: Setting Up the Yocto Build System](kata_part_2.md)
Clone the Yocto reference distribution (Poky) and the Raspberry Pi layer. Configure the build system and build your first minimal Linux image.

### 🔹 [Part 3: Custom Layer and First Recipe](kata_part_3.md)
Understand what Yocto layers and recipes are. Create your own layer and a simple `hello` recipe that runs on the Raspberry Pi.

### 🔹 [Part 4: Legacy Recipe for Migration Testing](kata_part_4.md)
Write a recipe using deprecated syntax to prepare for testing migration paths when upgrading to newer Yocto releases.

### 🔹 [Part 5: Restructuring with kas](kata_part_5.md)
Convert your manually configured project to a fully automated, reproducible setup using `kas`. Learn about `kas.yml` and why it’s a best practice.
